## Building, Requirements, Troubleshooting, Support

### Required Software 

1. CMake version 3.12 or newer. If the existing CMake version is too
old, you need to install a newer version. The NCEPLIBS-external code
contains `cmake-3.16.3` in subdirectory `cmake-src`. To install this
version:

```
cd ../cmake-src # assuming you are still in the build directory
./bootstrap --prefix=INSERT_PATH_HERE
make
make install
cd ../build
rm -fr CMakeCache.txt CMakeFiles
```
For building NCEPLIBS-external, use `/full_path_to_where_you_installed_cmake/bin/cmake` instead of just `cmake`.

2. A supported C/C++ and Fortran compiler, see table below. Other
versions may work, in particular if close to the versions listed
below. If the chosen compiler is not the default compiler on the
system, set the environment variables `export CC=...`, `export
CXX=...`, `export FC=...`, before invoking `cmake`. You may also
need to set `export SERIAL_CC=...`, `export SERIAL_CXX=...`, and
`export SERIAL_FC=...` to the same values

| Compiler vendor | Supported (tested) versions                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intel           | 18.0.3.222, 18.0.5.274, 19.0.2.187, 19.0.5.281, 19.1.0.166 |
| GNU             | 8.3.0, 9.1.0, 9.2.0, 10.2.0                                |

3. A supported MPI library unless installed as part of
NCEPLIBS-external, see table below. Other versions may work, in
particular if close to the versions listed below. It is recommended to
compile the MPI library with the same compilers used to compile
NCEPLIBS-external.

| MPI library     | Supported (tested) versions                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| MPICH           | 3.3.1, 3.3.2                                               |
| MVAPICH2        | 2.3.3                                                      |
| Open MPI        | 4.0.2                                                      |
| Intel MPI       | 2018.0.4, 2019.6.154, 2020.0.166                           |
| SGI MPT         | 2.19                                                       |

### Prepare to Build 

The following sections provide setup and usage instructions for a
range of systems with different level of support. The definitions of
the different support levels (e.g. pre-configured, configurable) are
on the [Supported Platforms and
Compilers](https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers)
page.

### Setup instructions for configurable systems

Configurable systems are macOS and Linux using the open-source GNU
compilers (or a combination of the LLVM clang and GNU gfortran
compiler for macOS), and the Intel compilers. Instructions are
provided for selected versions of macOS and several Linux
distributions/versions. As OS, compiler and library versions evolve
over time, the instructions may not reflect the latest versions at all
time. They should, however, work if the versions do not differ
significantly.

Note that Windows systems and other compilers (e.g. PGI) are not supported at this time.

- Setup instructions for macOS Mojave/Catalina using gcc and gfortran
  can be found in `doc/README_macos_gccgfortran.txt` in the
  repository.

- Setup instructions for macOS Mojave/Catalina using clang and
  gfortran can be found in `doc/README_macos_clanggfortran.txt` in the
  repository.

- Setup instructions for Red Hat Linux 8 using gcc and gfortran can be
  found in `doc/README_redhat_gnu.txt` in the repository.

- Setup instructions for Ubuntu Linux 18.04 using gcc and gfortran can
  be found in `doc/README_redhat_gnu.txt` in the repository.

- Setup instructions for TACC Stampede using icc and ifort can be
  found in `doc/README_stampede_intel.txt` in the repository.

- Setup instructions for MSU Orion using icc and ifort can be found in
  `doc/README_orion_intel.txt` in the repository.

### Setup instructions for pre-configured systems

Pre-configured systems do have existing installations of
NCEPLIBS-external and NCEPLIBS. Users should not have to build any of
these unless new versions of the external libraries or the NCEPLIBS
are to be tested. In this case, the following instructions will be
useful to repeat the steps the UFS developers have taken. They can
also be useful for users trying to install NCEPLIBS-external and
NCEPLIBS on other HPC platforms with preinstalled MPI, netCDF, ...

### Get and Build the Code

```
git clone -b ufs-v1.1.0 --recursive https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/NCEPLIBS-external
cd NCEPLIBS-external
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=INSERT_PATH_HERE ..
make <-jx>
```

If `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=` is omitted, the libraries will be
installed in directory `install` underneath the `build` directory. The
optional argument `<-jx>` speeds up the build process by using `x`
parallel compile tasks.

By default, NCEPLIBS-external will build and install all libraries
listed above except the optional CMake (see next section when this is
needed). This is primarily targeted for users who are setting up their
own workstations in order to get a consistent software stack. It is
important that the MPI wrappers use the same compiler that is used to
compile the other external libraries, the NCEP libraries and any UFS
application that depends on those.

Users working on HPC systems should use the MPI libraries installed by
the system administrators for the compiler they want to use. Usually
compilers and MPI libraries can be loaded as modules on those
systems. If other dependencies such as netCDF are also provided as
modules for the target compiler, then these should also be used. In
this case, users need to turn off explicitly the build of those
libraries as follows:

### Turn Off Specific Libraries

*How to turn off building ...*

1. CMake: not necessary, CMake is installed in a separate step only if
the default OS version is too old (see below).

2. MPI: Add `-DBUILD_MPI=OFF` to the cmake flags. If CMake cannot find
the MPI library, make sure that the MPI wrappers are in the `PATH`
environment variable, and set the environment variable `MPI_ROOT` to
the directory where MPI was installed.

3. zlib: zlib will be built as dependency for NetCDF or libpng. If
neither of those is built, the zlib build is also turned off.

4. HDF5: will be built as dependency for NetCDF.  If netCDF is not
built, the HDF5 build is also turned off.

5. NetCDF: Add `-DBUILD_NETCDF=OFF` to the cmake flags and set the
environment variable `NETCDF` to the directory where NetCDF was
installed. On some systems, the netCDF-c and netCDF-fortran libraries
are installed in separate locations. In this case, set set the
environment variable `NETCDF` to the directory where netcdf-c was
installed, and `NETCDF_FORTRAN` to the directory where netcdf-fortran
was installed. If NetCDF is not built, the libpng build must also be
turned off and an existing libpng installation, linking against the
same zlib version as NetCDF, must be used.

6. libpng: Add `-DBUILD_PNG=OFF` to the cmake flags. If CMake cannot
find the libpng library, set the environment variable `LIBPNG_ROOT` to
the directory where libpng was installed. See the troubleshooting
section about issues with linking to libz if the libpng build is
disabled but the NetCDF build is not. If libpng is not built, the
NetCDF build must also be turned off and an existing NetCDF
installation, linking against the same zlib version as libpng, must be
used.

7. libjpeg: libjpeg will be built as dependency for Jasper. If Jasper
is not built, the libjpeg build is also turned off.

8. Jasper: Add `-DBUILD_JASPER=OFF` to the cmake flags. If CMake
cannot find the Jasper library, set the environment variable
`Jasper_ROOT` to the directory where Jasper was installed (note the
case-sensitive name of the environment variable).

9. WGRIB2: Add `-DBUILD_WGRIB2=OFF` to the cmake flags. If CMake
cannot find the WGRIB2 Fortran modules or library, set the environment
variable `WGRIB2_ROOT` to the directory where WGRIB2 was
installed. Note that WGRIB2 installations vary between systems. For
the NCEPLIBS build to work, the WGRIB2 Fortran modules are expected in
`WGRIB2_ROOT/include` and the WGRIB2 library in `WGRIB2_ROOT/lib`.

10. ESMF: Add `-DBUILD_ESMF=OFF` to the cmake flags and set the
environment variable `ESMFMKFILE` to point to the file `esmf.mk` of
the ESMF installation.

The above options to turn off selected components can also be used by
advanced users who already have parts of the software stack installed
for the UFS.

### Troubleshooting

1. The cmake step reports an error that it cannot detect the MPI
type. Only the MPI libraries listed above have been preconfigured for
ESMF. Other libraries can be used by setting `-DMPITYPE=...` in the
cmake call, provided that ESMF supports this library (currently
supported by ESMF: mpi, mpt, mpich, mpich2, mpich3, mvapich2,
intelmpi, lam - see ESMF documentation for details).

2. The build fails because of undefined symbols in any of the
libraries. The most likely reason for this error is that cmake found a
different version of the library on the system, for example installed
by the Linux package manager or homebrew on macOS. While there is no
single solution for this problem, the following options have been used
successfully:

    - Remove the existing library, if possible (often it is not,
      because other software on the system depends on it)
    
    - Take the existing library out of the `PATH` and
      `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, if possible (not always, because other
      software installed in the same location, may be needed). On HPC
      systems, this often means unloading a specific module.
    
    - Look inside NCEPLIBS-external's top-level `CMakeLists.txt` if
      the offending library is one of the build targets, and if yes,
      turn it off.
    
    - If the offending library is a prerequisite for a build target
      (i.e. HDF5 is a prerequisite for NetCDF) and the build target
      itself is already installed on the system, try to turn off the
      build target (e.g. `option(BUILD_NETCDF "Build NetCDF?" OFF)`)
    
    - If the offending library is a prerequisite for a build target
      (i.e. HDF5 is a prerequisite for NetCDF) and the build target
      itself is _not_ installed on the system, you need to install the
      build target using the same method you used for installing the
      offending library and turn it off in `CMakeLists.txt`.
